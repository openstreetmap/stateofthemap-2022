MapImpact is a GAL Center project in Cusco, Peru, which aims to make more students aware of the problems that afflict their locality, to achieve this they will have to investigate these problems using OSM and associated tools such as Kobo Collect, as the main research tool. 

To develop this project GAL had a previous experience of 2 years, in which we work with high school students in different provinces of Cusco and help in the creation of the first YouthMappers Chapters in Peru, projects such as “Sexist advertising mapping”, “Sexual health” and “Garbage mapping in Larapa” were the result of this work.

This year we will work MapImpact also with university students and our intention is for students to understand digital maps not only as a tool to generate geospatial data, but also as a tool of social impact, that is, the process not end when they save the changes in OSM, they have to use that information to make visible a problem that afflicts their location.

In this talk we would like to share with you the whole process we follow to reach this point.
