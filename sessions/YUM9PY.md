Non-government organizations and local government units use geographic data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) to target humanitarian aid and public services. As more people start to depend on OSM, it is important to study data completeness in order to identify unmapped regions so that OSM volunteers can focus their attention on these areas. In this study, we propose a method to measure the data completeness of OSM building footprints using human settlements data.
