The Maputo Public Transport Mapathon project (hereafter called the Project) is a mostly volunteer activity based on the premise that Maputo, like other medium sized African cities, is at a pivotal point in its growth, one in which it can still avoid disastrous mistakes already made by other major cities, and can bypass development stages and create a sustainable and democratic transport system. Locally, most stakeholders are aware of this crossroads, but not many are aware of the importance and the potential of open data in contributing decisively for a sustainable and democratic management transport system. That is where #MapeandoMeuBairro comes in. The project has been mapping Maputo’s informal transport network – collecting data and putting it on OSM, through tag lists and other approaches that although inspired by other cities has probably devolved into something unique (both in good decisions and in errors made). Appart from the mapping, #MapeandoMeuBairro has been trying to instill in local government and other stakeholders the avareness that the OSM ecosystem has a large potential in low-resource governments like Mozambique’s.
By the end of 2019, about 85% of the network of the greater Maputo region has been put on OSM with good detail about stops and routes. Now that the Project is nearing the end of that initial stage of comprehensive mapping, it is now trying to answer the famous “we have the data, what’s next?” question (and hoping it does not degenerate into a “we have the data, so what?” question, like has happened before). We are now looking for ideas about and inspiration on how to use this data ourselves, promote its use by others, and how to integrate the data into other on-going endeavours, by us and by others. This includes preliminary ideas on app development, dynamic transport data integration, among others. Being mostly just enthusiastic mappers, we have little to no experience about these ideas and about the transport topic in general, so this presentation would be a channel to discuss our methods, allow others to critique and suggest – resulting in very valuable input.
