We outline methods for a) extracting the geometry of street blocks in urban centres using
OSM and remote sensing data, b) generating approximate cadastral maps of a
block given contained building footprints, and c) quantifying residents’ ability to navigate within
blocks through topological analysis of cadastral maps. This topological metric, termed “spatial
accessibility” and denoted k = 1, 2, 3, ..., determines whether areas of a city are informal
settlements, as blocks where k &gt; 2 contain cadastral parcels without direct access to formal road
networks.  We analysed 1 terabyte of OpenStreetMap data for 120 low and middle income (LMIC) countries.
