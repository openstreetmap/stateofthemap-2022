<h3 id="breakout">Self organized sessions</h3>
<p>
  Besides the main programme of SotM we offer space for self-organized sessions for discussions about topics that well placed in smaller rounds. The only requirement that we have to your topic is that it has to be related to OpenStreetMap. We use a <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/State_of_the_Map_2022/self-organized_sessions">dedicated OSM wiki page</a> for the organization of <em>online</em> self-organized sessions. For <em>on-site</em> self-organized sessions, we will set up a white board at the conference venue to reserve a time slot and room. The only requirements we have is that the participants have a conference ticket which grants them access to the conference platform that we use and that they abide to the conference's <a href="/codeofconduct">Code of Conduct</a>.
