<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>State of the Map 2021 took place online from <b>July 9 to 11 2021</b>. We have created an exciting program with you – the OpenStreetMap community. The conference was held on the amazing virtual platform <a href="https://venueless.org/en/"><em>venueless</em></a>, featuring a video-stream of talks, panels, lightning talks and Q&A sessions. Additionally, there were chat rooms for discussions and virtual sponsor booths, as well as interactive breakout sessions booked by groups of mutual interest or used without prior planning.</p>

<h3 id="academic">Academic Track</h3>
<p>The 2021 edition of the <a href="../calls/academic/#intro">academic track</a> featured nine scientific talks on <a class="page-scroll" href="#general_Sunday">Sunday</a>: five talks in the early time block in the main track, and four additional sessions in a breakout room in the later time block. These talks are indicated with a 🎓 symbol below.</p>

<h2 id="proceedings_academic_track">Proceedings of the Academic Track</h2>

  The academic committee published the conference track's proceedings on zenodo under the following link: <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5116434">doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5116434</a>. Access to each single abstract (which has its own doi) is also possible from this Zenodo community: <a href="https://zenodo.org/communities/sotm-2021">zenodo.org/communities/sotm-2021</a>. There you can find the full abstracts of all academic talks of this year's state of the map, as well as an editorial written by the <a href="../cfp/academic/#committee">scientific committee</a>.

<h3 id="breakout">Self organized sessions</h3>
<p>
  Besides the main programme of SotM we offer space for self-organized sessions. A lot of topics are well placed in smaller rounds. The only requirement that we have to your topic is that it has to be related to OpenStreetMap. We use a <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/State_of_the_Map_2021/self-organized_sessions">dedicated OSM wiki page</a> for the organization of such sessions so that everybody is able to jump in without any larger formal barrier. The only requirements we have is that the participants have a conference ticket which grants them access to the conference platform that we use and that they abide to the SotM Code of Conduct.
